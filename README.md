## About me

I am a motivated woman, constantly looking for a new way of selfimprovement in the Quality Assurance field to increase the live
comfort of others by improving the quality level of apps and other
developing software. I am always happy to work alongside and
meet new and full passion people. I have diverse interests and
passions, and I am always willing to explore new ones further, which
helps me work as a QA Engineer.
